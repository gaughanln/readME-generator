# 5 day forecast

## Description

I've created a README generator that works with the integrated terminal using node.js

#### Criteria:

* A command-line application that prompts the user with an array of questions and accepts the user input 
* A high quality README.md file is created and includes:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Table of Contents
  - Installation
  - Usage
  - License 
  - Contributing
  - Tests
  - Questions

* The table of contents should link to sections throughout the README
* The License will return a badge, link, and description about the license
* The questions area will contain an email address as well as the Github username and a link to the github profile
